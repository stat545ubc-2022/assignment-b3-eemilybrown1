This repository contains the code and app behind my Shiny App, which allows the user to visualize BC Liquor store data (Option A). I added 3 new features to the app that we created in class:
1. I added a shiny theme, "United", to improve the visuals of the app
2. I created separate tabs for the plot and table, to improve the visibility of the table (before you had to scroll down to see the table, this makes it easier to see.)
3. I made the data table interactive.

The source data for this app can be found here: https://github.com/daattali/shiny-server/blob/master/bcl/data/bcl-data.csv
